Targeted users would be Highschool teacher / Highschool Students:

There are 3 GUI applications that were developed in Java. ExamMaker, ExamTaker, ExamGrader.

First GUI program will take you through options to making the exam, what kinds of questions you would want to add on the test
i.e. Questions that have a number answer, multiple choice questions (MY FAVOIRTE xD), multiple choice questions that have multiple
answer choices, Fill in the blank questions, etc. This will allow the professor to make the exam and the program will then output
the .txt file in the proper format for the ExamTaker to read.

ExamTaker will be opened and used by students. Key feature of this is every time the same exam file is opened the questions are shown
in a random order, this will ideally prevent cheating. ExamTaker, is pretty stright forward, it will ask the questions depending
on the question and take in the proper response. Upon completion, answers are saved in a specific format as well in a .txt
file which is readable by the ExamGrader.

ExamGrader takes in the answer key file, and will take in the student answer file. It will run them against each other and will 
output a final score.

NOTES FOR EACH CLASSES:

Mohmed Hira- IN ExamTaker:
-You might have to change directory from where you are looking for the exam file.

- Student is prompted to enter in the exam file they would like to open, so if the exam file is saved in directory as exam1.txt, All you need to input is exam1. Then the exam file should open properly. 

-PLEASE READ PROMPTS CAREFULLY, "s" is to skip, there are a couple of yes and no prompts that are represented by "y" and "n" respectfully. 

-If you skip in initial exam it will ask you if you want to input an answer, if you do you can go ahead and input an answer, if you would like to skip again, you may do so. If you would like to leave it blank this is also acceptable 

-Then it will prompt you and ask if you would like any answers changed, NOTE: if you select yes, you must remember what question number you want to change. It was an optional enhancement to display the answers and questions again for the student and I did not do it, so they must remember which number they would like to change.

-After you make your changes, it will ask one more time to double check if its all good, and then if it is you follow the prompt.

-After this it will give you a goodbye message and the final answers text file will be saved in the format lastname_answers.txt note: lastname will be the last name you input.
